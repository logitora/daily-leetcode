# daily-leetcode
my solutions and examples. will be edited when problems are revisited for (hopefully) more optimal solutions
The purpose of this is to keep track of my solutions while doing a bunch of leetcode to have something to refer back to easily. This can also serve as a 
way of documenting my progress and thought processes.
Explanations are for future me to refer back to and also current me to reinforce what I did at that moment.
